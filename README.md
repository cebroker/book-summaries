# Books, books and hopefully lots of them

This repo is meant to collect the great thoughts of our team about the books we read.

## how to use this repo
1. Clone the repo
2. New books should go in their own folders
3. Add a `readme.md` file where you add the content
4. Announce new additions in slack so everybody can read them!
5. Thanks for sharing!

Quick reminders of important stuff we read and then forget. We encourage evryone to read and re-read them for your own pleasure.

The future version of us will think greatly about us ;)
